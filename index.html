                <p class="message-text">
                    My journey from the frozen Canadian landscape to the golden California beaches taught me something powerful: our environment doesn't define us—our mindset does. Every day I step onto the sand, I carry the resilience I built in the snow. This perspective drives everything I do.
                </p>
                <p class="message-text">
                    Beach volleyball is my arena, but my mission extends far beyond the court. I believe in empowering the next generation—especially young women—to build confidence, embrace their inner strength, and chase dreams that might seem impossible. That's why I created <strong>Piggy & Kay</strong>, a children's book series focused on building confidence and positive inner psychology from an early age.
                </p>
                <p class="message-text">
                    Whether I'm competing on the AVP Pro Tour, working with partners who share my values, or coaching athletes to unlock their potential, I'm guided by one principle: <em>lift as you climb</em>. I want to show that excellence in sport and meaningful impact in communities aren't separate paths—they're the same journey.
